I want you to generate a Discord bot feature in Python (using discord.py with app_commands and ui.View) that handles message reporting through reaction events. The flow and functionality should be structured very clearly, extremely decorative, and highly professional. Please follow these requirements exactly:

‚∏ª

üîπ Event Trigger
	‚Ä¢	When any user reacts to another user‚Äôs message with this specific custom emoji:
	‚Ä¢	<:messageReport:1406321078086668419>
	‚Ä¢	The bot should wait for a few seconds (3‚Äì5 seconds), then automatically remove the reaction from the message.
	‚Ä¢	Once the reaction is removed, the bot will send a decorative, detailed embed to a fixed moderation channel with this ID:
	‚Ä¢	1410841913111875675

‚∏ª

üîπ Embed Details (Report Log Embed)

The embed should be extremely detailed and visually decorative, containing all of the following information:
	‚Ä¢	Reporter (the person who reacted):
	‚Ä¢	Full Discord ID
	‚Ä¢	Full Discord username (e.g., username#1234)
	‚Ä¢	Full Discord display name (global/display name)
	‚Ä¢	Reported User (the person whose message got reacted to):
	‚Ä¢	Full Discord ID
	‚Ä¢	Full Discord username (e.g., username#1234)
	‚Ä¢	Full Discord display name
	‚Ä¢	Reported Message:
	‚Ä¢	Snippet/preview of the reported message content
	‚Ä¢	Message link (if available)

The embed should have:
	‚Ä¢	A main decorative header (title: ‚Äúüì¢ User Report System‚Äù).
	‚Ä¢	A timestamp field for when the report was created.
	‚Ä¢	A distinct color border (light red to indicate reporting).

‚∏ª

üîπ Interactive Moderation Buttons (Inside a UI View)

Below the main embed, the bot should send a secondary embed styled in light blue, titled:
	‚Ä¢	"üîß Moderation Actions"

This embed should contain 5 interactive buttons, each with unique styling, emoji, and color:
	1.	üóëÔ∏è Delete Message
	‚Ä¢	Style: Red (danger)
	‚Ä¢	Behavior:
	‚Ä¢	Deletes the reported message.
	‚Ä¢	Sends a direct message (DM) to the reported user saying:
"Your message was deleted by moderators due to violation of server rules. Please be careful moving forward."
	‚Ä¢	Sends a confirmation message embed in the moderation log channel, e.g.:
"@mentioned_moderator deleted the reported message. Action resolved."
	2.	‚ö†Ô∏è Warn User
	‚Ä¢	Style: Yellow (warning)
	‚Ä¢	Behavior:
	‚Ä¢	Issues a formal warning to the reported user.
	‚Ä¢	Sends them a DM warning message:
"You have been officially warned by moderators due to a reported message. Continued violations may result in further punishment."
	‚Ä¢	Sends a confirmation embed in the mod log channel, e.g.:
"@mentioned_moderator issued a warning to the reported user. Action resolved."
	3.	‚úÖ No Action Needed
	‚Ä¢	Style: Green (success)
	‚Ä¢	Behavior:
	‚Ä¢	Does not take any punitive action.
	‚Ä¢	Sends a DM to the reporter (the person who reacted with the emoji) saying:
"Your report was reviewed by moderators. No action was necessary. Thank you for keeping the community safe!"
	‚Ä¢	Sends a confirmation embed in the mod log channel, e.g.:
"@mentioned_moderator resolved this report with no action taken."
	4.	üîó Jump To Message
	‚Ä¢	Style: Grey (secondary)
	‚Ä¢	Behavior:
	‚Ä¢	Sends a clickable message link to the reported message directly into the moderation channel.
	‚Ä¢	Confirmation embed example:
"@mentioned_moderator accessed the reported message link. Action logged."
	5.	üåè Send Message
	‚Ä¢	Style: Blue (primary)
	‚Ä¢	Behavior:
	‚Ä¢	Bot sends a reply directly under the reported message in the public channel saying:
"@mentioned_user, your message was reported. Moderators are reviewing this case."
	‚Ä¢	Confirmation embed example:
"@mentioned_moderator sent a public moderation notice under the reported message. Action logged."

‚∏ª

üîπ Extra Important Behavior
	‚Ä¢	Every time a moderator/admin interacts with a button, the bot should:
	‚Ä¢	Perform the exact action tied to that button.
	‚Ä¢	Send a different variation of a confirmation embed (slightly randomized phrasing each time, to feel natural). Examples:
	‚Ä¢	"@mentioned_moderator handled this report. Issue resolved."
	‚Ä¢	"Report closed by @mentioned_moderator. Appropriate action was taken."
	‚Ä¢	"@mentioned_moderator reviewed and resolved this case."
	‚Ä¢	The secondary light blue embed (‚Äúüîß Moderation Actions‚Äù) holding the buttons must always remain directly below the main embed, clearly structured.

‚∏ª

üîπ Final Goal

The feature must:
	‚Ä¢	Be clean, scalable, and production-ready.
	‚Ä¢	Use discord.py event listeners for detecting the emoji reaction.
	‚Ä¢	Use discord.ui.View and button interactions for the moderation actions.
	‚Ä¢	Have proper error handling (e.g., if the reported message is already deleted, if the bot lacks permissions, etc.).
	‚Ä¢	All moderation actions should be logged in the moderation log channel ID: 1410841913111875675.
